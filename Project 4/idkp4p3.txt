    Factors to consider in gathering data from the web and social media include verification of what is often error-prone data. It is necessary to know if there are multiple sources and accounts on a particular piece of information before one can deem that it is, in fact, true. Additionally, the person or organization we obtain the data from is very important -- in the face of social media, one is more likely to get accurate information from BBC News' Facebook page over Sean Murray's Twitter feed. BBC News generally has a better reputation over anyone's posts that are limited to 120 characters. While BBC News cannot be the only page to see on the field of social media, it is thus imperative that fabricated information is identified.
    Because the CDC is a well-reputed government facility, users will easily trust the information given out by the CDC and CDC-related software, regardless of their age and background. If misinformation began spreading to these users because the database system picked up false or fabricated information about Zika, the health of these users (mostly unborn children in the wombs of pregnant users) could potentially be at risk (and die in childbirth). The media would be quick to cover at how wrong information was sent by the CDC, and CDC's reputation would receive a deadly blow, resulting in a change of employees or even disbanding entirely so that the government can save face. As for society in general, they would begin a distrust towards the government and the lies it has begun spreading, if these people haven't already been crippled by their incapability of giving birth to children with normal-sized heads.
